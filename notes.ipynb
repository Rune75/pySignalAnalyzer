    "\n",
    "q: what is the effect of cohorency in FFT analysis?\n",
    "a: Coherency is the measure of how well two signals are correlated. In the context of FFT analysis, coherency is the measure of how well the sampled data is correlated with the input signal. If the sampled data is not coherent with the input signal, the FFT analysis will not be able to extract the correct frequency components of the signal. This can lead to incorrect results and misinterpretation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "q: How to measure coherency in FFT analysis?\n",
    "a: Coherency can be measured using the coherence function, which is a measure of the correlation between two signals. The coherence function is calculated by taking the cross-spectral density of the two signals and dividing it by the product of the individual spectral densities. The coherence function ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect correlation and 0 indicating no correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "q: what is the formula to calculate coherent input signal frequency?\n",
    "a: The formula to calculate the coherent input signal frequency is given by:\n",
    "    f = n * fs / N\n",
    "    where:\n",
    "    f is the coherent input signal frequency,\n",
    "    n is the index of the peak in the FFT spectrum,\n",
    "    fs is the sampling frequency,\n",
    "    N is the number of samples in the FFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "q: what determines the number of frequency bins in FFT analysis?\n",
    "a: The number of frequency bins in FFT analysis is determined by the number of samples in the FFT. The number of frequency bins is equal to half the number of samples in the FFT, as the FFT output is symmetric about the Nyquist frequency. For example, if the FFT has 1024 samples, there will be 512 frequency bins in the output spectrum.\n",
